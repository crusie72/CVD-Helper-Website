			<h3>HOW CAN YOU ACHIEVE THIS?</h3>		
		<p>1)Avoid bad influences. Distance yourself from people who don’t support your efforts to stop drinking or respect the limits you’ve set. This may mean giving up certain friends and social connections.</p>
<p>2)Get rid of temptations. Remove all alcohol, bar ware, and other alcohol-related paraphernalia from your home and office.</p>
<p>3)When do you want to stop drinking or start drinking less? Tomorrow? In a week? Next month? Within six months? If you’re trying to stop drinking, set a specific quit date.</p>
<p>4)After you’ve set your goals to either stop or cut back your drinking, write down some ideas on how you can help yourself accomplish these goals.</p>
<p>5)Announce your goal. Let friends, family members, and co-workers know that you’re trying to stop or cut back on drinking. If they drink, ask them to support your recovery by not doing so in front of you.</p>
<p>6)Be upfront about your new limits. Make it clear that drinking will not be allowed in your home and that you may not be able to attend events where alcohol is being served.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7)It is possible to drink at a level that is less risky, while still having fun. There are a number of things you can do to make sure you stay within low risk levels and don't get to a stage where you are no longer capable of controlling your drinking.</p>
<p><ul><li>Set limits for yourself and stick to them<br></li><li>Start with non-alcoholic drinks and alternate with alcoholic drinks<br></li><li>&nbsp;Drink slowly<br></li><li>&nbsp;Try drinks with a lower alcohol content<br></li><li>&nbsp;Eat before or while you are drinking<br></li><li>&nbsp;If you participate in rounds of drinks try to include some non-alcoholic drinks.<br></li></ul></p>
