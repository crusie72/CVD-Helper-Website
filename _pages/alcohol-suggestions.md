<p>2)Get rid of temptations. Remove all alcohol, bar ware, and other alcohol-related paraphernalia from your home and office.</p>
<p>3)When do you want to stop drinking or start drinking less? Tomorrow? In a week? Next month? Within six months? If you’re trying to stop drinking, set a specific quit date.</p>
<p>4)After you’ve set your goals to either stop or cut back your drinking, write down some ideas on how you can help yourself accomplish these goals.</p>
<p>5)Announce your goal. Let friends, family members, and co-workers know that you’re trying to stop or cut back on drinking. If they drink, ask them to support your recovery by not doing so in front of you.</p>
<p>6)Be upfront about your new limits. Make it clear that drinking will not be allowed in your home and that you may not be able to attend events where alcohol is being served.&nbsp;</p>
