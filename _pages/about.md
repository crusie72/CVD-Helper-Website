<h4>About 'CVD' Helper</h4>		
		<p style="text-align: center;">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of death in Australia. There is no one cause for CVDs but the risk factors can increase the risk of further complexities. ‘CVD Helper’ is a website that aims to educate people about the measures to be taken to reduce the impact of cardiovascular diseases and also provide heart-healthy living guidance. Using CVD Helper, users can gain knowledge about various cardiovascular diseases, assess their lifestyle against the risk factors and get suggestions to improve their lifestyle after CVDs. Also, users can use the website to find various rehabilitation programs run by the government and other organizations to change their lifestyle to reduce the impact of certain risk factors.</p>
