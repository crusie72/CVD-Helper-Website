			<h3>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF being active?</h3>		
		<p>1) Risk factors for CVD are consistent throughout the world, and this includes lack of physical activity.Regular exercise will improve the quality of life</p><p>2) Regular physical activity helps reduce several cardiovascular risk factors including obesity,hypertension,diabetes.</p><p>3) Supervised exercise programs such as cardiac rehabilitation in patients who have undergone per cutaneous coronary interventions, heart valve surgery, have stable chronic heart failure</p><p>4) Elderly men walking more than 1.5 miles per day similarly reduced their risk of coronary disease.</p><p>5) Range of motion and stretching exercises such as yoga reduce sympathetic activity and improve several other cardiovascular risk parameters. </p><p>6) Exercise also stimulates the production of new blood vessels. As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. </p><p>7) Patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes who have achieved good glycaemic control, and have no complications,can benefit from the standard dose of physical activity.</p><p>8) Progressive physical activity is an effective treatment for improving walking distance in patients with claudication.</p><p>9) Regular low- to moderate-intensity physical activity appears to be safe for older people with heart disease.</p>

			<h3>HOW CAN YOU ACHIEVE THIS?</h3>		
		<p>1) Check with your doctor about safe levels of exercise. </p><p>2) Exercise within comfortable limits. Avoid physical activity if you feel unwell, tired, or sore from previous activity.</p><p>3) If you need to take angina medicine, carry it with you when you do the activity. </p><p>4) Take a mobile phone with you while you’re out exercising, particularly if you’re alone. That way if you feel unwell you can call someone.</p><p>5) Start doing the activity gradually and at a low intensity. For example, start with a gentle walk around the house or garden, or along flat pavements. Build up gradually to walking further distances or at a faster pace. </p><p>6) Slow down or stop if you feel short of breath, get irregular heart beats or chest pain. You should be able to talk normally while you’re doing the activity, without getting short of breath. </p><p>7) If you want to do more intense activity, check with your doctor first, and build up slowly over a number of weeks.</p>
