That way if you feel unwell you can call someone.</p><p>5) Start doing the activity gradually and at a low intensity. For example, start with a gentle walk around the house or garden, or along flat pavements. Build up gradually to walking further distances or at a faster pace. </p><p>6) Slow down or stop if you feel short of breath, get irregular heart beats or chest pain. You should be able to talk normally while you’re doing the activity, without getting short of breath. </p><p>7) If you want to do more intense activity, check with your doctor first, and build up slowly over a number of weeks.</p>
