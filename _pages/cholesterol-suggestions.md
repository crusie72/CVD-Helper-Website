			<h3>WHAT is the importance of Lower CHOLESTEROL?</h3>		
		<p>Cholesterol in food has only a small effect on the bad (LDL) cholesterol in your blood. Saturated and trans fats in food causes a much greater increase in LDL cholesterol. And eating healthy fats helps the cholesterol balance by decreasing LDL and increasing the good (HDL) cholesterol.</p><p>1) The benefits of lowering total and LDL cholesterol have been demonstrated extensively, particularly in individuals with heart disease or at high risk of heart disease or stroke.</p><p>2) Keeping total fat intake low is an important way to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of other chronic diseases. </p><p>3) Lowering LDL cholesterol levels has been repeatedly proven to improve Cardiovascular disease outcomes. </p><p>4)Reductions in LDL cholesterol approaching 50% are needed to halt the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque</p><p> </p>

			<h3>HOW CAN YOU control  CHOLESTEROL?</h3>		
		<p>1) A diet to lower cholesterol based on plant foods—grains, beans, vegetables, and fruits—is the best way to keep saturated fat intake low and to avoid cholesterol completely.</p><p>2) A healthy diet and regular exercise can help to lower the level of cholesterol in your blood.</p><p>3) It's important to keep cholesterol in check because high cholesterol levels increase your risk of heart disease and stroke.</p><p>4) Eating foods that contain unsaturated fat instead of saturated fat can actually help reduce cholesterol levels.</p><p>5)There is evidence that foods which contain certain added ingredients, such as plant sterols and stanols, can reduce levels of cholesterol in the blood. Plant sterols and stanols are found in nuts, seeds and legumes, vegetable oils, breads and cereals, and fruits and vegetables. </p><p>6) Eat 2 to 3 grams a day of plant sterols and stanols to assist in reducing high cholesterol. </p><p>7) If you’re overweight or obese, shed the extra pounds. Weight loss helps lower bad (LDL) cholesterol. Even a small to moderate weight loss just 10 to 20 pounds</p><p>8) An active lifestyle can also help to lower cholesterol levels. Activities range from walking and cycling to more vigorous exercise such as running and dancing.</p><p>9) If you have high cholesterol, your doctor may prescribe medications or lifestyle changes. For example, losing weight, increasing your physical activity, eating healthy foods, and quitting smoking can help bring your cholesterol levels down.</p>
